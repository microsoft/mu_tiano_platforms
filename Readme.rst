Getting Started
===============

The best way to get started is to review the details of this repository and look at the platforms in this repo.

- `Repo Details <RepoDetails.md>`_

Platforms can be found under the `Platforms` folder inside the root of this repo.

Details about the platform and how to build/use each platform can be found in their respective directories.

- `Q35 Platform <Platforms/QemuQ35Pkg/Docs/QemuQ35_ReadMe.md>`_
- `Ovmf upstream Platform <Platforms/OvmfPkg/ReadMe.md>`_

Feature Branches
================

This repository is used to develop and validate new core features on the Q35 platform.  This repository supports a
feature branch pattern where new features are developed and introduced in a branch.  The feature branch used for
development can serve as an standalone example of feature enablement or it can be merged into the main release branch
after development is complete.

To create a new feature branch:

1. Checkout the latest release branch
2. Create a branch named feature/{release you branched from}/<your feature name here>
3. Create a `Branch_ReadMe.md` in the docs folder of your new branch.

A template for `Branch_ReadMe.md` can be found in `docs/BranchReadMe_template.md`

An example of a feature branch name would be feature/202202/sbat.
The feature is sbat and it is based on release/202202.

Features must be "ON by default" and QemuQ35Pkg tries to avoid switches where possible. If your feature is required
to boot to an OS, please make changes to OvmfPkg which is considered the minimum platform.

Feature branches over two releases old will be archived. For example, feature/202002/sbat would get archived
when release/202102 was released, by moving it to archived/feature/202002/sbat. As such, feature branch owners
will need to rebase their feature on top of release branches as they are released and publish a new feature branch.

Example Branches
================

Example branches are different from feature branches in that they are not meant to merge into Q35 eventually.
The goal is for them to be shared as an example of how to integrate a specific feature.
Naming follows feature branches so an example example branch would be example/202102/prm.
In the example branch, please create a Branch_ReadMe.md in the docs folder, similar to a feature branch.
However, in your Branch_ReadMe.md, please specify that this is an example branch.

Commits should be laid out in an easy to understand manner with an empty commit that specifies that the example starts after the empty commit.
This can be done by running git commit --allow-empty -m "Example of {feature} starts here".
This will allow those you share it with to easily understand what commits are relevant.

Example branches also follow the same archiving process, so example branches will only last two releases.
Example branch owners will need to rebase their example branches for them to stay current.

Repo Maintenance
================

Upstream Sync Details
---------------------

The `upstream/main` branch should be automatically maitained by the script in the `upstream/sync` branch. These branches are
primarily on the internal repo and maintained by an internal pipeline.

In each commit, the "MU SOURCE COMMIT" comment at the end is the equivalent of the "cherry-picked from..." comment in a
`git cherry-pick -x ...` command.

For the integration process, the target commit should be selected and tagged `XXXX_Upstream` and pushed to all mirrors.
