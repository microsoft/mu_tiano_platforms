The goal of feature branches in `mu_tiano_platforms` is to showcase a feature and allow for development of that feature.
Branches shouldn't linger on unnecessarily.
They exist as proofs of concept and should try to become ready to be merged into a release branch or be archived as a
useful learning exercise.
