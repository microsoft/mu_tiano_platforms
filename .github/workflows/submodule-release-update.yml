# This workflow automatically creates a pull request for any submodule in the repo
# that has a new GitHub release available. The release must follow semantic versioning.
#
# The GitHub App ID and private key should be stored in the repository as a variable named `MU_ACCESS_APP_ID` and a
# secret named `MU_ACCESS_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` respectively.
#
# The GitHub App must grant the following permissions:
# - Read and write access to repository contents
# - Read and write access to pull requests
#
# NOTE: This file is automatically synchronized from Mu DevOps. Update the original file there
#       instead of the file in this repo.
