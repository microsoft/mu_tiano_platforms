# QemuQ35Pkg

**QemuQ35Pkg...**

- Is a derivative of OvmfPkg.
- Will not support Legacy BIOS or CSM.
- WIll not support S3 sleep functionality.
- Has a 32-bit PEI phase and a 64-bit DXE phase.
- Seeks to enable a tightly constrained virtual platform based on the QEMU Q35 machine type.

By solely focusing on the Q35 chipset, this package can be optimized such that it is allowed to break compatibility
with other QEMU supported chipsets. The Q35 chipset can be paired with an IA32 or X64 processor to enable a machine
that can emulate PC class hardware with industry standard features like SMM and PCI-E.

## Q35 Platform

Q35 is a machine type that QEMU emulates.
Below is a diagram from Qemu.org about the Q35 chipset which emulates a ICH9 (I/O controller hub).

The advantages of the ICH9 over the I440FX (which is what QEMU often emulates) is that it has PCI-E instead of just PCI
as well as having an integrated AHCI controller and no ISA bus.

## Firmware Features

QemuQ35Pkg is a great environment to demonstrate Project Mu features without any restricted or costly physical hardware.

Please refer to [Docs/feature_ReadMe.md](Docs/feature_ReadMe.md) for the latest information about features currently
enabled in QemuQ35Pkg.

## Compiling and Running QEMU

QemuQ35Pkg uses the Project Mu repositories and Edk2 PyTools for its build operations.
